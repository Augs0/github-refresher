# GitHub refresher challenge

## Instructions

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone your forked repo to your machine
3. Create a branch called feature/your-name (change to your name)
4. Add something inside the main tag
5. Push your changes to your forked repo
6. Make a pull request to the **original repo's dev branch** asking to merge your changes

### Bonus challenge

- Make a comment on somebody else's pull request

### Extra bonus challenge

- Review and merge somebody's change, only if it causes no conflicts

We will review the last step together later this week, but these are the actions you should feel comfortable with to get through this project.

### Note:

Don't forget to make good, detailed comments with commits :)
